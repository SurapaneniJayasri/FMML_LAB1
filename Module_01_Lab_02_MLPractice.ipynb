This can lead to several outcomes: Better Generalization: A larger validation set can help you better estimate the model's performance on unseen data. It can reveal issues with overfitting because the model has less data to overfit on during training. Robustness Testing: A larger validation set allows for more robust testing of the model's performance, ensuring it performs well on a broader range of data. Negative Impact on Model Performance: However, there are trade-offs to consider: Reduced Training Data: With more data allocated to validation, you have less data available for training. This can result in a model that doesn't learn as effectively, potentially leading to underfitting. Slower Training: Training may take longer as the model has fewer samples for learning.

Common split ratios are 70-15-15, 80-10-10, or 60-20-20, where the first number represents the percentage allocated to training, the second to validation, and the third to testing. These ratios ensure a reasonable balance between training and validation, while still reserving a separate test set for final evaluation.\n",

When you perform a single random split of your data into a training and validation set, the performance metric might be influenced by which data points ended up in the validation set. By repeatedly splitting the data into different subsets, you get a more stable estimate of the model's performance.\n",

Later Iterations: As you continue training for more iterations, the model may start to overfit the training data.

Early Stopping: To find the right balance, many practitioners use techniques like early stopping. This involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping when performance starts to degrade (indicating overfitting).

However, there's a risk of overfitting when using a small training dataset, especially if you train for a large number of iterations.

In such cases, regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, or using a simpler model architecture may be necessary to prevent overfitting. Small Validation Dataset:\n",

Increasing the number of iterations can help in the sense that it allows the model to be evaluated more times on the validation set, potentially leading to a more stable estimate of performance. However, the fundamental issue of a small validation dataset remains. It may not adequately represent the diversity of data the model will encounter in real-world scenarios. This can limit the model's ability to generalize effectively."
